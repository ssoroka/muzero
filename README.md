# Go muzero

An Go implementation of muzero based on the [python reference implementation](reference/python_reference_implementation.py) 
from the [muzero paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08265.pdf).

see [muzero.go](muzero.go).

The python reference implementation was written with numpy and tensorflow in mind, but the go bindings for tensorflow do not support training models, so that's not going to work. 

Currently looking for help getting this working with [Gorgonia](https://github.com/gorgonia/gorgonia).

I'm `@ssoroka` on the gophers slack channel.
